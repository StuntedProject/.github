# StunThink Project

This is an extended version of [Project Anya](https://github.com/project-anya) which got Top 53 on Google Bangkit 2022 Capstone Project. We combining Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Application to prevent and detect Stunting on Indonesia. 

This project is contributed by:

- Avei @Avei20 (Cloud, Backend, and Machine Learning Engineer)
- Fachri @mfachria (Mobile Developer)
- Rian @fukriandysisnadi (Machine Learning Engineer)

## Updates from Project Anya

- Application is now Available on Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.projectAnya.stunthink&pcampaignid=web_share)
- Google Cloud Architecture has been upgraded for optimizing free-tier on Google Cloud Platform, detailed can read on the paper.
- The food detection has 2 more classes than Project Anya with total of 13 food classes.
- The Height Detection algoritm still suck like before.

## Things needs to Improve

- Bussiness model
- Heigt Detection Algorithm
- Food Model and Implementing Federated Learning
- and much more.

## Project Structure

- `backend` repository contains backend code written on `Express`, `TypeScript`, `Prisma`, and `TensorFlow.js`
- `flask` repository contains backend code for Height Detection Algorithm written on `python3` and `Flask`. The algoritm is implemented using `OpenCV`. Detailed can be found on Paper of StunThink Project.
- `Mobile` repository contains full code of Mobile app. `Kotlin` is used 100% on this repository. `Jetpack Compose` is used to fullfil the 100% Kotlin. We using Clean Architecture design pattern on this Mobile App.
